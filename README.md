# T06-ID-Assignment1
Hi, I am Yu Zet, and I have chosen to do project idea 2. Porject idea 2 is about creating my own personal portfolio. It includes an introduction of myself and my qualifications.
## Design Process
This website is mainly targetted to recruiters that are interested in hiring me. As a recruiter, the most important thing to look out for is the person's qualifications and their interests. Through this website, recruiters can find out more about my qualifications as well as my hobbies and interests. *insert wireframes*
## Features
I created the website in a SPA format. In the first portion, I introduced myself and I included an "email me" button. When clicked, users will be sent to their mail.
The second portion consists of my education background and work experience. The images I have posted are scrollable using the 2 buttons provided.
The third and final portion consist of the projects I have done, and I included some fake projects as placeholders. The images are also scrollable using the 2 buttons. When the imaged is clicked, it sends you to a website related to the project.
### Features to be implemented in the future:
I would like to make my website more interactive by having more pages. I would also like to include links to my social media and have more types of interactive interfaces.
## Technologies used
HTML - used to do the main code of the website
CSS - used to make the website more visually appealing
Javascript - used to make the website interactive
## Testing
Under "projects I have done:", when any image is clicked, it sents the user to the same website, regardless of what the image shows. This bug has not been addressed. *test on mobile*
## Credits
Content - The fonts used were from Google Fonts
Media - The google image was obtained from design.google
Acknowledgements - I received inspirations for this project from my lecturers in Ngee Ann Polytechnic
